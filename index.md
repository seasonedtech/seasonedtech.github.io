I have about 19 years of hands on experience working with versions of Windows from 3.1 all the way to 11. Over the years, I have built many systems and tinkered with various applications. Also, I have been involved in a few Linux projects with the most recent being HefftorLinux which made headlines in the Linux world. In my personal life, I enjoy playing games such as World of Warcraft, Fortnite, Call of Duty: Warzone 2. From time to time, I may post content involving games and software recommendations.
